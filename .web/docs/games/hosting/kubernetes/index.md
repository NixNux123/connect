# Hosting Minekube Games on Kubernetes

Kubernetes is the preferred choice for self-hosting or providing Minekube game servers at scale, offering robust management capabilities through the Minekube web dashboard. This section will provide you with the necessary information to deploy and manage your Minekube game servers on Kubernetes, including how to scale up to becoming a provider yourself.

It's no coincidence that we have `kube` in our name!

## Why Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is not just about running containers; it's about simplifying complex technology to provide:

- **Scalability**: Effortlessly scale your game servers to meet player demand.
- **High Availability**: Achieve high availability with Kubernetes' self-healing and automated rollout/rollback capabilities.
- **Load Balancing**: Efficiently manage traffic distribution across your servers for optimal performance.

## Exclusive Management via Minekube Dashboard

One of the unique advantages of choosing Kubernetes for your game servers is the ability to manage everything through the Minekube web dashboard. This centralized management solution provides:

- **Intuitive Interface**: Easily deploy, monitor, and scale your game servers from a user-friendly web interface.
- **Full Control**: Manage server configurations, updates, and player access with just a few clicks.
- **Visibility**: Get insights into your server's performance and usage patterns to make informed decisions.

## Path to Becoming a Provider

By hosting your game servers on Kubernetes, you're already a step ahead in the journey of becoming a provider. With Minekube, you have the option to:

- **Rent Out Your Hardware**: Offer your Kubernetes cluster's resources to host game servers for friends or paying customers.
- **Expand Your Services**: Grow from hosting servers for personal use to becoming a full-fledged Minekube Games provider.

See the [Providers Documentation](../../providers/) for more information on how you can leverage your Kubernetes setup to start offering services to others and potentially monetize your infrastructure.
