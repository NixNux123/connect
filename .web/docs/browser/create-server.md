# Creating a Game Server on Minekube

Welcome to the initial step of bringing your Minecraft world to life on Minekube. Whether you're setting up a private server for you and your friends or planning to launch a public server for the community, this guide will walk you through creating your own game server on the Minekube platform, whether self-hosted or managed the web interface is always the same.

## Choose Your Game

**1. Explore the Catalog:** Start by browsing the Minekube Games catalog. Whether you're looking for a classic experience or something new with mods and custom worlds, you'll find it here.

**2. Select a Game Package:** Each game has specially tailored server packages. Choose the one that best fits the experience you want to provide on your server.

## Configure Your Server

**3. Customize Server Settings:** Name your server, select the optimal region for your player base, and configure privacy settings.

**4. Allocate Resources:** Decide on the CPU and memory allocations to ensure your server runs smoothly.

**5. Set Advanced Options (Optional):** For those with specific requirements, fine-tune your server with custom settings for plugins, world generation, and more.

## Deploy and Manage

**6. Deployment:** Once you're happy with your choices, it's time to deploy. Our system will handle the setup and inform you when your server is ready.

**7. Management Dashboard:** Use our comprehensive dashboard to control your server, from modifying settings to scaling resources as needed.

## Get Ready to Play

**8. Connect and Enjoy:** With your server up and running, connect to your new world and start your Minecraft adventure.

**9. Invite Your Friends (For private servers):** If you've set up a private server, invite your friends to join and play together.

*Hint: If you're considering making your server public and want to share it with the wider Minekube community, take a look at our [Launch Your Server](./launch/server) documentation next. It's a great way to gain visibility and players - and if you don't have a game server yet, we highly recommend creating one. You can even host game servers on your own infrastructure if you prefer.*

By following these steps, you'll set up a game server tailored to your preferences, ready for whatever Minecraft experience you're looking to create. Enjoy the journey, and happy crafting!
