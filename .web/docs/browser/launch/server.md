### Preparation for Launch

**1. Have a Game Server Ready:**
Before launching, you need to have an active game server. If you haven't set one up yet, please refer to our [Creating a Game Server](../create-server) documentation.

Make sure your server is fully configured, tested, and ready to handle an influx of new players. This includes optimizing performance and ensuring all gameplay elements are functioning correctly.

### Launching Your Server

**3. Define Your Server Listing:**
Craft an engaging description of your server that highlights its unique features and what makes it special. Include high-quality images or videos that showcase the server environment.

Decide whether your server will be publicly listed for anyone to join or if it will require an application or an invitation to participate.

**5. Choose the Right Time:**
Timing can be everything. Select a launch date and time that maximizes potential player availability and interest.

### Post-Launch

**6. Monitor and Engage:**
After your server goes live, monitor its performance and player feedback. Engage with the community to encourage growth and retention.

*Note: Launching a server is a significant step. If you're new to server management or looking to trial run your setup, consider creating a private server first. This allows you to fine-tune the experience before sharing it with the public. You can always transition to a public server when you're ready.*
