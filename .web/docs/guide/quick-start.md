Proceed the `Quick Start` from there:

If you want to use the Connect Dashboard after the set-up, follow the steps below.
You can later import your Minecraft Endpoints to the dashboard to manage them.

## Step 1: Choose a Connector

Connectors are the link between your Minecraft Endpoints and the Connect Network.

-> [Go to Available Connectors](/guide/connectors/#available-connectors)

## Step 2: Launch your Connector

Follow the guide of the Connector you chose to install and launch it.
The first time the Connector is launched, the Endpoint will be protected with a token,
that you can reset in the Dashboard at any time.

-> If you face serious issues [get help](#getting-help) in the Discord.

## Done!

Your Minecraft server is now protected by the Connect Network and players can join it
at `<endpoint>.play.minekube.net`!

**Next Steps:** Consider to import your Endpoints to the Connect Dashboard.
